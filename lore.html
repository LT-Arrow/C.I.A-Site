    <h1>C.I.A Lore Overview</h1>
    <p>
      The Central Intelligence Archives were established after the first recorded multiversal breach,
      when entities began crossing between realities. The organization was founded to document, study,
      and contain these phenomena.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, agents discovered that each universe holds unique laws of physics and magic.
      The Archives operate across these dimensions to protect humanity and preserve balance.
    </p>

      <h2>Divisions within the C.I.A</h2>
