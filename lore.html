    <h1>C.I.A Lore Overview</h1>
    <p>
      The Central Intelligence Archives were established after the first recorded multiversal breach, when entities began crossing between realities. The organization was founded to document, study, and contain these phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, agents discovered that each universe holds unique laws of physics and magic. The Archives operate across these dimensions to protect humanity and preserve balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divisions within the CIA include:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Containment Division:</b> Responsible for neutralizing threats and maintaining secrecy.</li>
        <li><b>Research Division:</b> Studies interdimensional phenomena and anomalies.</li>
        <li><b>Field Agents:</b> Handle direct investigations and first contact situations.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each case logged within the Archives represents a significant threat or unexplained occurrence, often beyond human understanding.
