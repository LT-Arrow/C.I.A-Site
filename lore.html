    <h2>Origin of the C.I.A</h2>
    <p>
      The Cryptic Intelligence Agency was formed in 2020, shortly after the global COVID outbreak, 
      when strange anomalies began to appear across the world. The agency’s original purpose was 
      to secretly investigate and contain any paranormal or extraterrestrial events that threatened humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2057, with the emergence of the <strong>Immortal Virus</strong>, C.I.A operations expanded globally 
      as small towns and research zones fell to infection. While the virus is not yet worldwide, 
      containment efforts have escalated to unprecedented levels.
