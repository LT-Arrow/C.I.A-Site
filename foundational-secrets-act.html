<h1>CIA FOUNDATION</h1>
<h2>FOUNDATIONAL SECRETS ACT</h2>

<div class="document-box">
THE FOUNDATIONAL SECRETS ACT

(UNREDACTED — FOUNDATION ARCHIVE MASTER COPY)

CIA FOUNDATION
OFFICE OF ABSOLUTE OVERSIGHT

⸻

DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION

Title: The Foundational Secrets Act
Ratification Date: August 17, 1947
Last Amended: November 23, 1963
Authority Level: OMEGA / DIRECTORATE PRIME
Legal Status: Extra-Constitutional
Public Record: NONEXISTENT

⸻

PREAMBLE

In recognition that certain truths pose an existential threat to civilization itself,
and that conventional governance is insufficient to contain phenomena beyond human origin or comprehension,
the undersigned establish this Act.

This Act supersedes:
	•	Constitutional authority
	•	Executive oversight
	•	International law
	•	Moral consensus

Where survival conflicts with transparency, survival prevails.

⸻

ARTICLE I — DEFINITION OF FOUNDATIONAL SECRETS

Foundational Secrets are defined as:
	1.	Knowledge that destabilizes collective reality
	2.	Evidence of non-human intelligence interacting with Earth
	3.	Technologies that violate known physical laws
	4.	Temporal, dimensional, or metaphysical incursions
	5.	Proof that humanity is not the dominant intelligence

Disclosure of such knowledge is classified as a Civilization-Level Threat Event (CLTE).

⸻

ARTICLE II — ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CIA FOUNDATION

The CIA Foundation is hereby constituted as:
	•	A supranational containment authority
	•	Independent of electoral governance
	•	Empowered to act without consent, notification, or review

Its mandate:

Secure. Contain. Suppress. Endure.

⸻

ARTICLE III — CLEARANCE AND IGNORANCE DOCTRINE
	1.	Ignorance is a containment tool
	2.	No individual, regardless of office, is entitled to total knowledge
	3.	Clearance is granted strictly on:
	•	Psychological resilience
	•	Ideological compliance
	•	Willingness to authorize irreversible actions

Presidents are not exempt.

⸻

ARTICLE IV — THE PRESIDENTIAL EXCEPTION (REVOKED)

Originally, the President of the United States was designated:
	•	Final civilian arbiter
	•	Moral counterbalance
	•	Emergency disclosure authority

REVOKED — NOVEMBER 23, 1963

Reason:

“Civilian morality is incompatible with existential secrecy.”

⸻

ARTICLE V — PROJECTS OF ABSOLUTE NECESSITY

Authorized operations include but are not limited to:
	•	Non-human entity containment
	•	Human experimentation under anomaly exposure
	•	Temporal interference and memory alteration
	•	Covert elimination of destabilizing individuals
	•	Historical narrative correction

Ethics review is optional.
Failure is unacceptable.

⸻

ARTICLE VI — THE KENNEDY AMENDMENT (NULLIFIED)

Subject: President John F. Kennedy
Clearance Codename: COLD ANCHOR

Kennedy proposed:
	•	Shared anomaly research with foreign powers
	•	Reduction of anomaly weapon stockpiles
	•	Civilian oversight committees
	•	Disclosure thresholds

Foundation determination:

“Subject exhibits uncontrollable moral idealism.”

Status:
	•	Amendment rejected
	•	Subject clearance frozen
	•	Internal watch authorization approved

⸻

ARTICLE VII — MULTI-CAUSE TERMINATION EVENTS

When an individual presents:
	•	Ideological destabilization
	•	Knowledge spill risk
	•	Structural interference

A Multi-Cause Termination Event may be enacted.

This includes:
	•	Plausible deniability layers
	•	Narrative convergence
	•	Anomalous masking variables

History will remember what is useful, not what is true.

⸻

ARTICLE VIII — OMEGA BLACKOUT PROTOCOL

Upon activation:
	•	All records are sealed
	•	Witness accounts destabilized
	•	Physical evidence fragmented
	•	Temporal inconsistencies permitted

Truth becomes irrelevant.

⸻

ARTICLE IX — POSTHUMOUS CONTROL

Death does not end containment.

Authorized measures:
	•	Legacy management
	•	Ideological neutralization
	•	Cultural myth shaping
	•	Declassification manipulation

A dead symbol is more powerful than a living dissenter.

⸻

ARTICLE X — PUNISHMENT FOR BREACH

Unauthorized disclosure results in:
	•	Immediate detainment
	•	Cognitive erasure
	•	Permanent reassignment
	•	Or termination

There is no appeal.

⸻

DIRECTORATE CLOSING STATEMENT

“The public believes secrets protect governments.
In truth, secrets protect reality itself.”

⸻

FINAL CLAUSE

This Act is eternal.

It does not expire.
It does not forgive.
It does not regret.

Those who enforce it will be hated
by those who never know what was prevented.

⸻
